<ol>
<li>Fork Phile on github</li>
<li>Make your changes</li>
<li>Run the test cases locally (call <code>./phing</code> in the root and choose &quot;run test suite&quot;), make sure no test fails</li>
<li>Create a pull request on github into the <code>develop</code> branch</li>
<li><code>Travis CI</code> will build and test your pull request automatically, if all tests passed go to next step</li>
<li>Each pull request has to be reviewed by <strong>two other people</strong>. If the pull request is reviewed by at least two people (give +1 in the comments), one of the maintainer will accept the request and merge it into the core.</li>
</ol>
<p>The maintainers also has a veto, in cases where the code structure is not Ok or an other pull request will add the same feature.</p>
<p>To avoid inconsistencies, ask and discuss your idea on <a href="https://gitter.im/PhileCMS/Phile">gitter.im</a>, before you start by your self. Lets talk to each other, to improve PhileCMS.</p>
